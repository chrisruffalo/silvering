# Silvering

*[Silvering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvering) is a chemical process that, among other uses, enables useful reflection.* 

Silvering is also a library that aims to make repetitive reflective tasks easier. This includes tasks like 
descending into a class hierarchy for reflection or traversing an object graph. The aim is to make these
tasks safer and easier while handling edge and error cases.

The bottom line is *silvering makes reflection better*.
